			<h3><b>Services offered:</b></h3>
	        <p><b>Developmental Editing:</b> This is for authors who have a completed manuscript. The editor looks through the manuscript to help with pace, characters, plot issues, structure, and voice. This results in a report full of feedback and some in-line edits.</p>
	        <p><b>Line Editing:</b> This takes a closer look at each individual sentence. The editor looks at each sentence and paragraph to help with sentence structure, wordiness, and clarity. This results in a manuscript returned with in-line edits, comments, and possible changes marked throughout.</p>
	        <p><b>Manuscript Assessment:</b> This is for authors on a tighter budget. You want an editor's eye but you can't afford a full developmental edit. The editor will read your manuscript and send back a one-page overview discussing major changes and suggestions. This can be for completed or unfinished works depending on what stage you want the editor to review it. There will be no in-line edits.</p>
	        <p><b>E-book Quality Assurance:</b> This takes a look at the complete or published e-book and reads through the entire book looking for layout errors or other errors introduced while converting a manuscript into an e-book.</p>
	        <p><b>Query Letters:</b> These are letters written for the express purpose of submitting your manuscript to agents and publishers. The editor will read through your manuscript and write a one page letter to hook the prospective readers.</p>
	        <h3><b>Pricing:</b></h3>
	        <p>For both <b>developmental editing and line editing</b> I charge $0.01&ndash;$0.02 a word. Prices vary based on the length and complexity of the work. This means there are no surprises when it comes to cost; I give you a flat rate for the work after reviewing it. </p>
	        <p><b>Manuscript assessments</b> are half-a-cent a word; this also results in a flat-rate. Manuscript Assessments are only available for 20,000 words or more.</p>
	        <p><b>Query letters and E-book QA</b> are done at a flat rate depending on the length of the work, rates begin at $50.</p>
	        <p>Payment is accepted through Paypal and you will receive a final quote after the work is reviewed.</p>
	        <h3><b>Promotion:</b></h3>
	        <p>When you publish your work all you have to do is let me know and it will be tweeted, blogged about, and posted all over the internet!</p>
	        <p><i>Please <a href="../contact/">contact me</a> to discuss your needs and options, and to get an accurate pricing.</i></p>
