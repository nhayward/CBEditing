				<p>"I've been lucky to work with several editors who've improved my books and made me a better writer. I appreciate Carly's style. The feedback is concise and easy to understand. Her willingness to discuss not just this first book but where I'm going in the series is a great help, the kind of support I need as I try something new."</p>
				<p>-<i>Cheryl Harper, author of</i> Can&#39;t Help Falling in Love <i>and</i> Least Likely to Fall in Love</p>

					<div id="sand-prince"><img src="../img/SandPrince_cover_cb_editing.jpg" /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sand-Prince-Demon-Door/dp/1620157624/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446489025&sr=8-1&keywords=sand+prince" target="_blank">View on Amazon</a></div>
				<p>"I met Carly the same day I saw Mad Max Fury Road, so she'll forever be linked in my mind to Furiosa--someone you absolutely want on your side! With Carly's guidance, I turned my pretty okay novel into something so much more, something alive. I always felt she loved my characters as much as I did--she simply got what I was trying to do, and helped me do it. I have no doubt that my book (and hopefully many to come) are vastly improved by her involvement."</p>
				<p>-<i>Kim Alexander, author of</i> The Sand Prince</p>

				<br />
				<p>"Carly's incisive mind, solid understanding of storytelling, and experience in the traditional publishing industry set her apart from the freelance editing crowd. When I send her my best work I'm confident that her edits will make it even better."</p>
				<p>-<i>Ty Black</i></p>
				<br />
				<p>"Carly is an amazing editor. I went through five different (and terrible) queries before finding her. She took my most recent query and turned it into a query I am proud to submit. She also crafted a fantastic synopsis for me!"</p>
				<p>-<i>Laura Wilson-Anderson, Sci-fi and Fantasy Author</i></p>
				<br />
				<p>"As far as Carly goes, she offers the complete experience. Her process for developmental editing leaves no stone unturned and assures that every facet, both in the perspective of grammar and storytelling are covered and revised for a more fulfilling literary experience. I was completely satisfied with working with Ms. Bornstein."</p>
				<p>-<i>Theo Taylor, Sci-fi and Fantasy author</i></p>
				<br />
				<p>"Unprepared to finish a sleek piece, I was on edge. I discovered that the editing assistance of Ms. Bornstein is not only a strong choice, but essential, as she delivered on all fronts and was overall flawless. This client considers her at the top of his list."</p>
				<p>-<i>Spencer English, Staff Writer at AV Wire</i></p>
